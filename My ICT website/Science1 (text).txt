<h1>Minerals</h1>
<p><i>Mineral</i> - is defined as a naturally occuring, inorganic solid with a 
definite chemical composition and an ordered internal structure.
Every mineral is unique, but they exhibit general characteristics:</p>
<ol>
<li><i>Naturally-occuring</i> - Minerals should exist naturally. Steel and synthetic diamonds are created artificially, and therefore, are not minerals.
<li><i>Inorganic</i> - Minerals are limited to substances formed througth inorganic process, and exclude materials derived from living organisms which involved organic process. 
Coal, which is composed of remains of plants and other inorganic compounds, in not a mineral.
<li><i>Solid</i> - All liquids and gases, even those that are naturally formed such as petroleum, are not considered minerals. Ice formedin the glaciers is considered a mineral
but water is not.
<li><i>Definite chemical composition</i> - The chemical composition of minerals should express the exact chemical formula with the elements and compounds in specific ratios. The only 
expection is the aromic substitution, which is characteristic of certain minerals.
<li><i>Ordered internal structure</i> - The atoms in minerals are organized in a regular, repetitive geometric patterns or crystal stucture. Volcanic glass, even if it is formed naturally, is not considered
a mineral because it is a amorphous and has no form. Substances  that fulfill all the requirements but do not have an ordered internal structure are called <i>mineraloids</i>. Examples are of 
mineraloids (amber, obsidian, opal, and pearl).

<h3>Composition of Minerals</h3>
<p>In terms of composition, minerals can be classfied into several mineral classes which are mainly composed of elements that are abundant on Earth's crust.</p>
<ol><li><i>Silicates</i> are composed primarily of silicon-oxygen tetrahedrons (SiO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>). Silicates are the major rock-forming minerals and includes olvine ((Mg,Fe)<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>) 
and quartz (SiO<sub>2</sub>).
<li><i>Oxides</i> consist of metal cations bonded to oxygen anions. Common oxide minerals are magnetite (Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>) and hematite (Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>).
<li><i>Sulfides</i> consists of a metal carbon bonded to sulfide(S<sup>-2</sup>). They are common ore minerals along with oxides since metals form a high proportion of the mineral. Examples of sulfides 
are galena (PbS) and pyrite (FeS<sub>2</sub>).
<li><i>Sulfates</i> consist of a metal cation bonded to the SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> anionic group. They usually precipitate out of water near Earth's surface. An 
example of sulfate is gypsum(CaSO<sub>4</sub>-2H<sub>2</sub>O).
<li><i>Halides</i> are composed of a halogen ion such as chlorine or fluorine which is forms halite or rock salt (NaCl) and fluorine (CaF<sub>2</sub>).
<li><i>Carbonates</i> are characterized by the presence of carbonic ion (CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup>) which bonds elements such as calcium or magnesium to form calcite 
(CaCO<sub>3</sub>) or dolomite (CaMg(CO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>).
<li><i>Native metals</i> consist of a single metal such as copper(Cu) and gold (Au).

<h3>Crystal Structure of Minerals</h3>
<p><i>Crystal structure</i> is dependent on the chemical composition of the mineral. Minerals that have similar chemical compositions often share the same crystal structure and generally belong to the same 
crystal system. There are six crystal systems used in grouping minerals based on structure: triclinic, nonoclinic, orthorhombic, terragonal, hexagonal, and isometric structures.</p>

<h3>Physical Properties of Minerals</h3>
<p>There are around 4000 minerals and each has a unique set of physical properties including crystal formation, habit, clevage, fracture, luster, color, streak, hardness, 
density, magnetism, taste, feel, and reacion to acid. These physical properties are useful for identifying minerals using a systematic method such as Dana classification.</p>
<ol><li><b>Crystal Form and Habit</b> - since minerals have a definete shape which crystallizes in a specific crystal form. Habit, on the other hand, is the outward appearance of the minerals's crystal 
form. It can be described as granular, tabular, dendritic, acicular, massive, reniform, drusy, or encrusting.
<li><b>Clevage and Fracture</b> - The manner in which a mineral breaks is dependent on its molecular bonding and structure. The tendency of a mineral to break along planes 
of weakness os known as clevage. It can be described both in the number and directions of clevage planes and its quality (excellent, good, poor, or absent). Minerals with 
excellent clevage will break break into smooth, flat, parallel surfaces. A good clevage will result in small, smooth, step-like flat surfaces. Clevage surfaces are diffucult to 
identify in minerals with poor clevage, while minerals that do not have clevage will fracture either in an irregular manner or as conchoidal fracture (smooth, curved surfaces).
<li><b>Luster</b> - The luster  of a mineral describes the appearance of light reflected from a mineral surface. A mineral may be described  as metallic, like that if a polished metal. Alternatively, 
it may be  described as nonmetallic, which can be vitreous (like glass), resinous (like resin), pearlescent, silky, greasy, earthy, and dull.
<li><b>Color and Streak</b> - Although color is the most obvious mineral property, it is not a reliable feature for identifying minerals because it can be altered by chemical 
impurities  within its structure. Quartz is colorless but slight impurities can produce a vareity of colors, such as white (like in milky quartz), yellow (like in citrine), purple (like 
in amethyst), or black (like in smoky quartz).<br> <i>Streak</i> is the color of a mineral in its powdered form. It can be obtained by rubbing the mineral on an abrasive ceramic tile called streak plate.
<li><b>Hardness</b> - The Hardness of a mineral is a measurement of the strength of the chemical bonds in its structure. It can be measured by scratching it with another mineral or 
 a reference material with known hardeness. The <i>Mohs scale of hardness</i> is a relative measure of these hardness using common materials and standard minerals to represent a specific hardness value.
<li><b>Density</b> - <i>Specific gravity</i> is a measure of the density of a mineral. It is the weight of a mineral relative to the weight of an equal volume of water. Most common mineral have 
a specific gravity of 2.7, while gold has 19.
</ol>
<p>Other properties with the corresponding minerals that exhibit these properties are as follow:
<ul>
<li>Magnetism (magnetite)
<li>Taste (halite is salty)
<li>Effervescence or reaction to acid (calcite and other carbonates will react with weak acid)
<li>Feel (talc is greasy)
</ul>
