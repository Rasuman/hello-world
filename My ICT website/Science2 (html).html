<tr><td><h1>Rocks and Rock Cycle</h1>
<p>A rock is a naturally-occuring, coherent aggregate of minerals such as natural glass or organic matter. Rocks are found in the lithosphere, which is derived  from the Greek word <i>lithos</i> which means "stone." 
The lithosphere is the rigid, rocky, outermost part of Earth, composed of the crust and uppermost part of the upper mantle.</p>
<h3>The Rock Cycle</h3>
<p>The <i>rock cycle</i> is a model that describes all the processes by which rocks are formed, modified, transported, decomposed, melted, and reformed. These processes occur both on Earth's surface 
and underneath. Essentially, it is a dynamic cycle of processes and products.</p>
<p>When magma (molten rock beneath the surface) is exposed to lower temperature, minerals and amorphous solids crystallizes and solidifies, forming igneous rocks. These rocks may be then be brought 
 to the surface throught <i>uplift</i>, where they are exposed to <i>weathering</i> and <i>erosion</i>. The processes of weathering and erosion break down into smaller pieces called <i>sediments</i>. These 
particles may be undergo <i>transportation</i> via agents such as wind, water, glaciers, rivers, and oceans until they settle in an area where they will undertake deposition. As more materials settle 
on top of each other, temperature and pressure increases and the sediments at the bottom may undergo <i>lithification</i>. Lithification trasforms sediment into sedimentary rocks. As temperature and pressure 
increases due to continuous burial and tectonic activity, the sedimentary rocks undergo the process of <i>metamorphism</i>, transforming them into metamorphic rocks. If temperature continues to increase and 
exceeds the melting point of the rocks, the rocks will eventually undergo <i>melting</i> and turn them into magma.</p>
<p>The path of rocks in the rock cycle may vary. For example, igneous rocks may be transformed into metamorphic rocks without initially becoming a sedimentary rock. Similarity, metamorphic rocks may be weathered 
and eventually lithified into sedimentary rocks without passing through processes that produce igneous rocks.</p>

<h3>Formation of Igneous Rocks</h3>
<p>Igneous rocks re formed form the cooling and solidification of magma or lava. The word "igneous" is derived from latin <i>igneus</i>, which means "fiery" or "on fire." Igneous rocks form at much higher 
temperature compared to other types of rocks. There are three ways in which igneous rocks can form:</p>
<ol>
<li><i>Below the surface</i>, from slowly flowing magma - This result in the formation of crystals that are visible to the naked eye without the aid of a magnifying lens. These types of igneous rocks
 are called <i>intrusive</i> or <i>plutonic</i>, since they cool underneath the surface as plutons. Examples of these rocks include granite, diorite, and syenite.
<li><i>On the surface</i>, from rapidly cooling magma - This results in the formation of very small crystals that may not be visible without the use of a magnifying lens. Igneous rocks like these are called 
extrusive or volcanic, since they are usually extruded during volcanic eruptions. Examples of these are basalt, andesite, and rhyolite.
<li><i>On the surface</i>, from the consolidation of particle erupted by explosive volcanic activity - When volcanoes erupt violently, the lava exiting the volcanoes are ripped apart into smaller pieces by 
rapidly expanding gases in the lava, just like the bubbles in the bottle of soft drinks shaken vigorously. Depending on how much gas is present, the particles may solidify as small as ash or as large as basketball. 
When these paricles come together on the surface via lithification, they form pyroplastic igneous rocks. Examples of this type of rock are ignimbrite (locally known as adobe), tuff, and volcanic breccia.

<h3>Formation of Sedimentary Rocks</h3>
<p>Sedimentary rocks are the products of the lithification of particles produced by the weathering of other preexisting rocks. Thus, sedimentary rocks can have parent material derived from older igneous 
metamorphic, and even sedimentary rocks. Aside from rock particles, they may also be comprised of mineral fragments and organic material, or in some cases, minerals that precipitate from solution. Collectively, 
these components are called <i>sediments</i>. The term was derived from the Latin <i>sedentarius</i>, which means "sitting," as these sediments will eventually be deposited and remain until they are transformed 
into sedimentary rocks. There are three ways in which sedimentary rocks can form:</p>
<ol>
<li>From the cementation of sediments that have been deposited, buried, and compacted over a long peroid of time - This type of sedimentary rock is called <i>clastic</i>, and they can be differentiated based on the 
the size of the sediments of clasts in the rocks. Examples of these rocks include shale, sandstone, and conglomerate.
<li>From the precipitaion of minerals from ions in solution - Rocks that are exposed to water and oxygen can slowly expierience chemical changes such as oxydation (rusting) and hydrolysis through time. 
These processes break down rocks into thier chemical components, particularly into ions that can be carried by running water in solution. Once the solution is saturated, the precipitation of minerals like calcite 
and halite can occur, leading into the formation of <i>chemical sedimentary rocks</i>. Examples of these types of rocks include limestone, dolosite, and rock salt.
<li>From the compaction and cementation of plant and/or animal remains - These types of sedimentary rocks are called <i>bioclasts</i>. Examples of bioclastic sedimentary rocks are coquina and organic limestone.

<h3>Formation of Metamorphic Rocks</h3>
<p>Metamorphic rocks form when preexisting or parent rocks (whether igneous, sedimentary, or even metamorphic) are altered by heat, pressure, and chemical activity of fluids. These processes are collectively called 
<i>metamorphism</i>, meaning "change in form." It usually occurs underneath the surface, although not as deep as the igneous environement. There are two major types of metamorphism depending on which factor causes 
the alteration of the parent rock:</p>
<ol>
<li>When the dominant altering factor is pressure, usually due to tectonic activity, the flat and/or elongated mineral components of preexisting rocks react by aligning prependicular to the axis of the pressure. 
This result in a layered or banded apperance in the rocks called <i>foliation</i>, and these types of rocks are called foliated metamorphic rocks. The terms comes from the Latin <i>folium</i>, and called 
<i>regional metamorphism</i>, as tectonic processes involved in this process are regional in scale that produces mountain chains, Examples of these include slate, schist, and gneiss.
<li>When the dominant altering factor is heat, usually from direct contact between an older rock materials and in intruding body of magma, the parent rocks may undergo a fundamental change in texture due to recrystllization, 
or even change in mineralogy when chemically-active fluids are also involved. This process is called <i>contact metamorphism</i>, It results in rocks like marble and quartzite that are called <i>nonfoliated metamorphic rocks</i>.
</ol>
<p>Although heat and pressure are still the dominant for the change in form, metamorphism may immediately happen from instantaneous events such as faulting for <i>dynamic metamorphism</i> and meteorite impact 
for <i>shock metamorphism</i>.</p>

<h3>Rock Cycle as a Biogeochemical Cycle</h3>
<p>Humankind primarily used rocks for building and improving communities. Houses, bridges, roads, schools, and factories, among other things, are build on a rock's solid foundation. However, it is also improtant to see 
the important to see the importance of the rock cycle on to Earth as a system.</p>
<p>Although the rock cycle's main realm is the geosphere, it is not disconnected from the four subsystems. When rocks are uplifted and exposed to the surface, it interacts with the hydrosphere, atmosphere, and biosphere 
as it will undergo physical, chemical, and biological weathering once it is on the surface. As smaller sediments are formed through weathering, soil could become organic-rich soil conductive for plant growth. The 
plant roots will then further biological weathering as it wedges into the bedrock along for more soil to form. Soil is very important component of the other biogeochemical cycles.</p>
