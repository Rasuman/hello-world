<tr><td><h1>Classfication of Rocks</h1>
<p>Rocks can be classfied based on thier differences in texture and composition. <i>Texture</i> refers to the size, shape, and arrangement of minerals grains and other constituents in a rock. These factors are controlled 
by the processes that formed the rock. Thus, a rock's texture could provide information about the environment where the rock was formed. Because igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic processes are distinct, 
thier resulting textures are also distinct.</p>

<h3>Igneous Rocks</h3>
<p>Igneous rocks are either <i>crystalline</i> when they form from cooled magma or lava, or <i>pyroclastic</i>, when they are made of consolidated eruption products like volcanic ash.</p>
<ol>
<li><i>Crytalline textures</i> differ depending on how fast and where the cooling took place.
<ol type="a">
<li><i>Intrusive</i> or <i>plutonic rocks</i> that form from slowly cooled magma have time to form large mineral crystals that are visible without the aid of a magnifying lens. The resulting texture is 
called <i>phaneritic</i>, which is derived from the Greek <i>phaneros</i> meaning "visible." In cases when minerals crystallize very slowly at depth, a <i>pegmatitic texture</i> is one composed of very large 
crystals (large than 2 to 3cm).
<li><i>Extrusive</i> or <i>volcanic rocks</i> that form from rapidly cooled magma usually exhibit <i>aphanic</i> textures. Aphanitic is derived from the Greek <i>aphaneros</i> it means "visible." Thus, 
the mineral crystals of aphanitic rocks cannot be distinguished without the use if a magnifying lens. A special volcanic texture is displayed by rocks that cool rapidly that the mineral crystals do not 
form, usually when lava is expelled underwater. This results in rocks that appear glassy. Another is the <i>vesicular texture</i>, which is a result of gases escaping while the volcanic rock is being formed.
<li>There are instances when magma body intrudes into a shallow depth near Earth's surface, and begins to crystallize slowly. Then subsquent volcanic activity extrudes the partially crystallized magma 
onto the surface, thereby speeding up the rate of cooling. Such rocks may show at least two distinct crystal sizes, which results into <i>porphyritic texture</i>.
</ol>
<li><i>Pyroclastic</i> is derived from the Greek <i>pyro</i> which means "fire" and <i>klastos</i> which means "shattered." This texture is the result of the lithification of erupted volcanic materials; thus, 
these types of rocks are distinguished from each other by size of its particle components.
<ul><li>
Igneous rocks are mostly composed of the materials found in the Bowen's reaction series, which shows the order and assembly of the minerals as they crytallize when the temperature of magma decreases. It is composed of 
felsic minerals (quartz, muscovite, potassium feldspar, and plagioclase) and mafic minerals (biotite, amphibole, pyroxene, and olivine). Color can be used as indicator of the composition of a rock or mineral.
<li>
The <i>color index</i> can be used to identify the composition of most igneous rocks. Light colors (white, light gray, tan, and pink) indicate a <i>felfic composition</i>. Felsic composition are rich in silica 
(SiO<sub>2</sub>). Dark colors (black and brown) indicate a <i>mafic composition</i> or <i>ultramafic composition</i>. Mafic composition are poor in silica but rich in iron and magnesium. <i>Intermediate composition</i> have 
an intermediate color - gray or consisting of equal parts of dark and light mineral.
</ul>
</ol>

<h3>Sedimentary Rocks</h3>
<p>Sedimentary rocks are <i>clastic</i> when they form from lithification of rock and mineral fragments such as quartz, feldspar, and clay. Sedimentary rocks are <i>crystalline</i> when they precipitate out of solution 
which forms dolomite, calcite, halite, and gypsum. Sedimentary rocks can also be <i>bioclastic</i> when it forms as the result of the accumulation of organic materials or biologic activity. It may even contain remnants 
of plants, corals, shell, or fossil fragments.</p>
<p>Sedimentary clastic texture may further be refined whetever the shapes of the individual grains are angular or rounded.</p>
<p>Clasts may be also be described based on thier sizes and is divided into three types: clay or silt, sand, and gravel.</p>
<ol>
<li>Clay or silt it is less than 1/16mm. They are not visible to the naked eye
<li>Sand grains are between 1/16mm and 2mm
<li>Gravel have sizes that are greater than 2mm.
</ol>

<h3>Metamorphic Rocks</h3>
<p>Metamorphic rocks may be <i>foliated</i> when the dominant agent of metamorphic is pressure, or <i>crystalline</i> when the dominant agent is heat.</p>
<ol>
<li>Platy or elongated minerals align themselves parallel to the axis of pressure, resulting in a layered apperance or <i>foliation</i>. Minerals differ in foliation based on their composition:
<ul>
<li>If the minerals are microscopic, the rock may not appear foliated to the naked eye. This type of texture is called <i>slaty</i>.
<li>If the minerals are barely visible to the naked eye, their allignment result in an obvious but not very well-defined foliation. This type of texture is called <i>phyllitic</i>.
<li>If the minerals are visible to the naked eye, their layering is more distinct and results in a texture called <i>schistose</i>.
<li>If the minerals are visible and elonged, this type of texture is called <i>gnessic</i>.
</ul>
<li><i>Crystalline textures</i> result when the parent rock is exposed with enough heat that it includes recrystallization of the existing minerals. Crystalline metamorphic rocks are usually composeed 
only of one type of mineral.
<p>Metamorphic rocks are mostly composed of minerals that only form at high temperatures and pressures associated with the process of metamorphism. These minerals are known as <i>index minerals</i>.</p>
